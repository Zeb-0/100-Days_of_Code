## Everything is Object

### copy()- function
- is a function that makes a shallow copy of a list, dict or any other objects in python.
- essentially creates a new container but the items inside are the same as the original - the items are referenced.
- modifying any item in shallow copy effects the changes in the original and vice-versa.
