# DAY 28 - 100-Days_of_Code

- decided to do some html-css work to refresh my memory on some front-end Development
## HTML
- Divisions & Spans
    * <div></div> 
    * <span></span>
- Text-Based elements:
    * <h11></ha>
    * <p></p>
    * <b> - offsets text stylistically
    <strong> - gives strong importance to text
    <em> - place `stressed emphasis` on text
    <i> - convey txt in `alternative voice/tone` like in quotes
